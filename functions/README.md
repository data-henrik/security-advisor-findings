# Cloud Functions for Security Scans
This repo holds sample actions to populate findings (occurrences) in the IBM Cloud Security Advisor dashboard. See `setup.sh` for rough steps. Basically, create the actions and related sequences, assign privileges by Access Group settings, then invoke one of the sequences.

More details to come, hopefully... ;-)
